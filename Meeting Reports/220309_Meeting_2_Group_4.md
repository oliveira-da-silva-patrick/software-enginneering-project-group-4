## Meeting Content

This meeting's goal was to discuss feedback given to our idea and how to procede with development. 

During today's presentation, the teacher asked us for which mobile OS we are developping the game. We noticed that everyone of us uses Android. We decided to stick with Android because it is easier for everyone to test it later.

We also decided to continue learning Unity and imposed a deadline to ourselves for next week. The next time we meet, 
everyone should be able to make basic things with the Unity Engine.
