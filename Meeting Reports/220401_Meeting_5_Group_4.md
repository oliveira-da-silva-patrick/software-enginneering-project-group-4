###  Agenda


#### Skill tree
It was decided that the previously uploaded skill tree menu draft would be adapted and that the abilities would be sellable with a "reset tree" button, for which a player would receive all the spent ECTS. The fine tuning of the skill tree would be done once the game is more advanced.

#### Chests

Chests will be included at a later point, such that a player could open them and receive either coins or an enemy would be spawned. Coins would also be dropped whenever a player defeats an enemy. The coins would be picked up by the same circlecast system that Daniel is currently using for enemy movement.

#### Room movement

For the development phase, a fixed map will be used, and Matteo will create room scenes to simulate an environment a player can freely move in.

#### Pausing menu

Patrick gave an update on the pausing functionality, which will pause everything on the screen and it was decided to always include a small button that allows the player to enter the pausing menu, as well as automatically save every time a player enters a room.
