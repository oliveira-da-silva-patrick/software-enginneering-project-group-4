###  Agenda


#### Previous week
The tilesets have been uploaded and rooms have been created over the last week. Saving a game & starting a new game have been added to the main menu by Patrick. A test version of the npc dialogue interaction has also been created by Patrick. It is to note that the dialogue still has some bugs when clicking on an NPC. 

#### Known bugs

Enemy bullets go through walls and player bullets disappear immediately.

#### Health bar

A healthbar has been created by Tiago and is almost ready for a merge into the main branch. It was decided to create a fixed health bar for the final boss.

#### Final boss

The final boss will use Skilltree abilities from the player and will have different ability stages based on it's health.


#### Plans for next week

Tiago will continue to work on the health bars. Patrick will do the menu design and fix the NPC interactions. Matteo will do checks for the escalator and work on ECTS incrementation for cleared rooms. Matteo will also work on an animation when switching between rooms, as well as the soundtrack. Daniel will work on general sounds, enemy & player animations, coin tracking and the final boss.

#### Soundtrack

It was decided that there will be attacking sounds, a menu ost and a different menu ost.

#### Prerelease deadline

It was decided that the prototype will be given out to testers on Sunday (15.05.2022).
