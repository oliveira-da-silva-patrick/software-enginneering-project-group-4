## Meeting Content
In this meeting we created the powerpoint for the end of sprint 2 presentation. We talked about what we did during the 2nd sprint and whether we did everything we planned to do.
We concluded that much of the time during the 2nd sprint was invested into testing and bug fixing instead of the original plan to spend most of the time working on graphics.
