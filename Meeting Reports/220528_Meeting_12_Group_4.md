###  Agenda

The goal of this meeting was to decide on what everyone is going to do for the last presentation/deadline.


During the meeting we decided to split up the work for the commercial video. Matteo is the editor, Patrick is responsible for the soundtrack. Tiago and Daniel are responsible for the recording. 
The groupe decided that everyone should finish commenting their own code, after that Patrick is going to record the 15 minutes video.
