## Meeting Content
  
  In this meeting each member of the team presented their Unity project and the features they were able to implement.

At this stage the entire team has sufficient knowledge of Unity to implement the most important features that will be required for our game. Furthermore we decided to upload each of our projects to GitHub so that we may gather our scripts and start working on a single main branch.

For the next meeting it was established that we will make a division of the workload and prepare for the 2nd group presentation. In the meantime each member will keep on working individually.
