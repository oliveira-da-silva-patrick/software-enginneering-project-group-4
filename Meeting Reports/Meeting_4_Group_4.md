###  Agenda

he goal of this meeting was to decide on a final direction of the game, split up the workload and finalize the presentation.


During the meeting we decided to have a game which is going to be accesible by android users only for now. 
The story of the game was decided to be an outbreak of an virus in which the player has to get the vaccine.
The game environment is the university that has 6 floors and each floor is designed after different fields of the FSTM. 
The workload was split up in 4 parts. It was decided that Daniel is going to work on the enemies behaviour, 
Patrick is going to work on the UI and menus, Matteo is going to work on the miscelleous and Tiago is going to work on the player behaviour. 



For the next meeting we decided to create a new game scene and have each member to begin working on their respective part of the game.
